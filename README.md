Welcome to the official Martian Brood Wireframe README!

This file will detail how exactly to navigate the Repository and any information that may be helpful to keep in mind while browsing.

Martian Brood is supposed to be a simple management game for Steven Henderson's first Capstone Project at Thinkful.

The basic premise of Martian Brood is that, in the near future, humanity has successfully colonized Mars. Humans have established numerous settlements and even been able to do some basic terraforming, including making lakes and forests. However, despite a realtively peaceful colonization effort, a danger is sleeping beneath the surface.

A scientific expedition stumbles across a frozen alien body in the ice of the Northern Polar cap. That alien is you. You make short work of the research team and repurpose the biomass, thus beginning your Lair and the Game.

In Martian Brood the player must juggle 3 separate resources; biomass, aliens, and alien structures. Aliens come in numerous forms, but their primary purposes are defending the lair and harvesting biomass. Alien Structures allow the lair to specialize in different fields, granting the player access to more unique aliens and special bonuses that can effect the base gameplay. Biomass is required to produce both.

The game also uses a turn based system. Creating aliens and alien structures can take several "solar days", or turns. "Tasks" are assigned and the turn is ended. Then the player receives numerous "reactions" based on what "tasks" they set for the turn.

In addition to the resource management, the player must also be wary of the humans on Mars. Although small settlements will be generous sources of biomass, expanding too recklessly will lead to lots of potential dangers for the player!

Martian Brood may seem like an ambitious project, but it is planned to be really quite simple. The technical aspects are never supposed to evolve beyond basic addition and subtraction. Lots of database manipulation will be going on, but nothing that should ever be overwhelming. The turn based system makes it so that there is only one bottleneck, or place where the server has to do much. Everything the player sets during their turn gets put into in a local store, and then the server and client exchange information over a brief loading screen, and the player is presented with a new batch of data to play around with.

Users can also opt to Create an Account and Log into that Account on subsequent visits. The Account will include any progress they have made previously. All their aliens, alien structures, and biomass will be readily available as if they never logged off in the first place.

There are 4 unique pages to see in this wireframe:
  1- The Inventory Screen at {link}
  2- The Main Screen at {link}
  3- The Gameplay Screen at {link}
  4- The Reaction Screen at {link}

All the screens are linked to each other and can be easily accessed by following the right paths. At any time the User can click "Martian Brood" in the Navigation Bar to make it back to Inventory Screen. The Inventory Screen has direct links to the Main Screen, Gameplay Screen, and the Reaction Screen. Additionally, a User can also go to the Main Screen and navigate to the Gameplay Screen by clicking "Quickplay". From the Gameplay Screen they can press the "Set Tasks" button to navigate to the Reaction Screen. From the Reaction Screen they can press the "Ok" button to navigate back to the Gameplay Screen. Please note, the "Set Tasks" button is disabled when a User is on the Reaction Screen!
